## Chronology

Here is a clear and concise chronology that outlines the origins of digital accessibility and provides an understanding of its development over time.

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international non-profit organization focused on the public interest. It brings together member organizations, full-time staff, and the public to collaboratively develop web standards.

The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is a crucial part of W3C's mission to benefit society. It develops strategies, standards, and resources to ensure the web is accessible to people with disabilities.

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (WCAG) were published as a W3C Recommendation on May 5, 1999.

Since then, digital accessibility has become an integral part of the web. The WCAG have evolved to their latest version (2.2) and are expected to continue evolving. Most countries, with Western nations leading the way, driven by a strong inclusivity movement, have developed their own digital accessibility policies, all based on the WCAG guidelines.


| 1989  | 1994 | 1997 | 1999 | 2008 | 2018 | 2023 |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| World Wide Web  | Word Wild Web Constortium  | Web Accessibility Initiative | WCAG1.0 | WCAG 2.0 | WCAG 2.1 | WCAG 2.2 |


## 1999 WCAG 1.0

In May 1999, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 1.0 were established. The first step in establishing guidelines for web accessibility, WCAG 1.0 focused primarily on HTML. This edition of WCAG included the conformance levels we still know today: A, AA, and AAA.

From the perspective of an entire website or web page, conformance to Level A would mean meeting only the success criteria for Level A, while conformance to Level AAA would mean meeting all of the success criteria: A, AA, and AAA, making AAA the most comprehensive.

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 version 1.0 includes 14 guidelines, the first 11 of which aim to ensure elegant transformation of content in different user contexts

These 14 guidelines were divided into three priority levels:

- Priority 1 - the most basic level of web accessibility
- Priority 2 - addressing the main barriers faced by users with disabilities (visually impaired, blind, deaf, hard of hearing, etc.)
- Priority 3 - significant improvement in web accessibility

### The 14 WCAG 1.0 Guidelines

WCAG 1.0 has 14 guidelines, the first 11 of which are aimed at ensuring that content transforms gracefully in different user contexts:

- Provide equivalent alternatives for visual and auditory content (static or animated images, audio and video);
- Do not rely exclusively on colors;
- Use HTML markup and CSS style sheets appropriately;
- Clarify the use of natural language;
- Create HTML tables that transform gracefully;
- Ensure that pages that contain new techniques (programmable objects, CSS styles) transform gracefully;
- Give the user control over changes in content as it varies over time (flashes, movements, content refreshes, redirects);
- Provide direct access to built-in user interfaces (Flash objects, Java applets);
- Design for device independence (mouse, keyboard, touch, etc.);
- Use intermediate solutions until user agents have better accessibility support;
- Use W3C technologies and guidelines.
- All three aim to make content understandable and navigable:
- Provide context and orientation information;
- Provide clear navigation mechanisms;
- Make sure pages are clear and simple.

### WCAG Accessibility levels

| Level | Objective | Feasibility | Example |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| A  | Achieve a minimum level of accessibility. | Essential success criteria that can reasonably be applied to all web resources. |Color is not the only visual means of conveying information. |
| AA  | Improve the level of accessibility  | Additional success criteria that can reasonably be applied to all web resources. | Small texts have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5 |
| AAA  | Achieving a higher level of accessibility.  | Success criteria not applicable to all web resources. | Small texts have a contrast ratio of at least 7. |


## 2008 WCAG 2.0

WCAG 2.0 also takes a more rigorous thematic approach by structuring 12 core guidelines under **4 core principles**: POUR.

POUR stands for **Perceivable**, **Operable**, **Understandable**, and **Robust**.

These guidelines serve as categories for the success criteria that make up WCAG; each success criterion addresses one or more barriers to the content’s perception, use, comprehension, and/or robustness for all users.

Like WCAG 1.0, this version of the W3C’s web accessibility guidelines categorizes the guidelines into three primary testing levels: A, AA, and AAA.

## 2018 WCAG 2.1

In June 2028, WCAG 2.1 was released. Rather than a complete overhaul as was seen in the transition from version 1.0 to version 2.0, WCAG 2.1 added success criteria to the existing 2.0 guidelines. This addition of new rules—rather than re-establishing old rules—is a testament to the careful crafting of WCAG 2.0. Many of the new rules in WCAG 2.1 remove accessibility barriers that have become apparent as mobile web browsing has become more popular.

## 2023 WCAG 2.2

In August 2023, WCAG 2.2 is published. Again an extension of the existing standards, the WCAG 2.2 working draft currently includes new success criteria and implements a change to an existing success criterion (2.4.7: Focus Visible will move from conformance level AA to level A).

## Summary of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 and 2.2.

**Perceivable**

- Provide text alternatives to non-text content.
- Provide captions and other alternatives for multimedia.
- Create content that can be presented in a variety of ways, including through assistive technologies, without losing meaning.
- Make content easy for the user to see and hear.

**Usable**

- Make all features keyboard accessible.
- Give the user enough time to read and use the content.
- Do not design content that could cause seizures or physical reactions.
- Help the user navigate and find the content.
- Make it easy to use input tools other than the keyboard.

**Comprehensible**

- Make text readable and understandable.
- Make content appear and function in predictable ways.
- Help the user avoid and correct errors.

**Robust**

- Optimize compatibility with current and future users' tools.

Each of the twelve guidelines is broken down into one or more "success criteria" of level A, AA or AAA, which become the basis for evaluating the accessibility of the site.


### Guidelines

The guidelines outlined above provide the basic goals that authors should achieve in order to make content **more accessible to people with disabilities**.

These consider the elements that all websites generally use:

- Image
- Video
- Colors
- Links
- Tables
- Scripts
- Frames
- Required elements
- Navigation
- Information structuring
- Consultation
- Presentation

They can be divided into **3 main areas**: **editorial**, **development** and **graphics**. Each of these are broken down into different criteria.

In short, the guidelines provide the **framework and general goals** to help authors understand the criteria for success and better implement the techniques.

## The Legislation

Most countries around the world have laws, policies or guidelines* that protect people with disabilities from discrimination and help remove barriers to the full enjoyment of their human rights and inclusion in society.

Most digital accessibility legislation is based on the international standard published by the W3C, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

### The Equality Act 2010

The Equality Act 2010 is a law that protects the rights of people with disabilities by requiring UK businesses to provide equal access to their websites and services.

### Section 508

A U.S. federal law requiring that electronic and information technology be accessible to people with disabilities, including federal employees.

### ADA Title III

Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act covers public accommodations and services and applies to all kinds of digital solutions, like websites, mobile apps, and more.

### European Accessibility Act

EU legislation establishing standard accessibility requirements for websites, mobile applications and other digital solutions in the public and private sectors in Member States.

### ACT 2005-102 and RGAA

Ensuring equal access to digital services in France, others will follow with the deployment of EAA in 2025.

As mentioned earlier, each country has its own internal regulations, all of which are based on the WCAG guidelines.


## EAA: Fields of Application

The new European standard defined by the EAA defines the scope of application:

- Computers and operating systems
- Smart phones
- Television equipment and broadcasting services
- Self-service terminals (ATMs, ticket machines, check-in kiosks)
- E-books and digital publications
- E-commerce platforms
- Banking services
- Public transport services

In France, the **General Framework for Improving Accessibility RGAA - Version 4.1.2**, in particular via **Article 47 of Law No. 2005-102 of February 11, 2005 for Equal Rights and Opportunities** goes further and broadens the scope of application to companies with a turnover threshold of 250 million euros or more.

## Criteria applicable to emails

Now that we have reviewed the history, foundations, various laws, and areas of application of digital accessibility, we can focus on applying all of these WCAG guidelines to the world of emails. Many articles on this subject exist, providing a general idea of what is applicable or not. However, many of them mix WCAG criteria with broader recommendations, which can lead to some confusion.

Here is the complete list of accessibility criteria directly derived from WCAG and applicable to emails. Adhering to these criteria ensures full compliance with accessibility standards.

For this section, I have exclusively relied on the article by Kris Rivenburgh and extracted the criteria specifically related to emailing. Visit his page titled "[Email Accessibility Best Practices](https://accessible.org/email-accessibility/)" to learn more.

## Tests and Criteria

To further enhance email accessibility, I created a page based on the French framework in this area, the "General Accessibility Framework for Administrations" (RGAA). Fully based on WCAG, this framework outlines the criteria necessary to ensure full compliance.

The "Tests and Criteria" page is simply the most comprehensive and clear summary I have found on the web regarding WCAG guidelines.

The logical classification and enumeration of criteria make it easier to identify key points of attention when analyzing an email or a web page. The descriptions of the tests to be performed for each criterion provide valuable assistance, making it easier to understand and remember the compliance criteria.
